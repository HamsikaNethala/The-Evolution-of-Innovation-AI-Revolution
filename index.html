									<h2><a href="#" >Intro: Shape of the Future</a></h2>
								</header>
								<p style="text-align: left;">
									&emsp;&emsp;Artificial intelligence is growing and being used now more than ever before. But even looking all the way back from the industrial revolution to the start of the 
									internet, technological advancements have continuously refined human progress. The question is no longer <b>will AI change our future?</b>, but rather, <b>how can we stay ahead of its rapid evolution?</b>
									<br />&emsp;&emsp;AI was once a term signifying a technologically advanced futuristic world, but now the future is right before our eyes. AI is an intelligence that allows machines to perform tasks that usually requires 
									human level thinking.  AI has had a high impact in our everyday lives. In ways such as adding them to social media platforms like Instagram in which Meta AI allows you to generate pictures, edit photos, search information, 
									and have conversations with AI replications of celebrities, tv show characters, and even a character that you’ve created. Today, AI is transforming industries around the globe, enhancing decision- making and driving innovations 
									that were once unimaginable. According to Adam Uzialko, senior writer of <em>businessnewsdaily</em>, “<em>AI is adept at processing and analyzing troves of data much faster than a human brain. AI software can take data and present 
									synthesized courses of action to human users, helping us determine potential consequences and streamline business- decision making.</em>” AI can, will, and is being used as a supportive tool to help advance the business world, making 
									all aspects more efficient, sophisticated, and adjustable to consumer preferences. It is able to identify what a consumer might expect from a product, how a product can be made to lessen user error, and is able to be a valuable 
									asset to consumers. An example of this is <b>Amazon Personalize</b>. This analyzes products that users show interest to, engage in and personalizes your search recommendations. Amazon uses this to maximize profits by attracting 
									customers to items that they subconsciously want to indulge in. <em>Amazon</em> says it this way, “<em>With the Amazon Personalize recommendation engine, you can deliver hyper-personalized user experiences in real-time at scale to improve 
									user engagement, customer loyalty, and business results.</em>” It’s able to be used to better fit and customize products, and developments to meet the needs of each tier from CEO’s to the clients. According to <em>6sense</em>, with <b>Lily AI</b>, they 
									are able to expand marketing strategies, “<em>allowing businesses to engage with their customers” by “dramatically improving their on-site search conversion, relevant product recommendations and demand forecasting</em>” which allows for "<em>8-9 figure revenue uplift.</em>" 
									The use of artificial intelligence is able to make products and services expand into new markets, positively changing the way things run.

									<h2><a href="#" >AI and the industrial Revolution</a></h2>
								</header>
								<p style="text-align: left;">
									&emsp;&emsp;The increase of AI in our day to day lives has caused confusion and anxiety as this is something that people are completely unfamiliar with. Certain jobs such as customer service 
									representatives, data entry clerks, and taxi drivers are being replaced and all jobs are being impacted, but this type of uprising and job turmoil has happened in the past as well. 
									As they say, “history repeats itself” and we can see that by looking back at the industrial revolution. The industrial revolution was a key era in American and British history that paved the 
									way for modernization in the U.S and other parts of the world. It was a time full of technological and economic advancements, shifting from an agrarian economy to an industrial one. 
									Some of the most important advancements came from it. These new advancements were achieved due to new technological innovations that were unfamiliar just like today’s AI. These technologies 
									were made to complete tasks that were once done by hand. They were made to be trend disruptors, to create a better and more hopeful future that improves the conditions for all. One of the new 
									developments was the <b>steam engine</b>. It used water to create power that powered  trains, ships, steel production, factories, mines, etc. Since the engines were able to exert much more 
									power than human or animal labor, it allowed for higher speed of operations, higher efficiency, and lower costs, but displaced sailboats, animal drawn carriages, and water wheels. Similarly the 
									advancement of AI is like the introduction of the steam engine. It’s a powerful tool that can outstand human speed. Without the invention of the steam engine, we could have never reached 
									large scale factories, modern transportation systems, and ultimately we would not be where we are today. In the same way, artificial intelligence will have this same type of impact, it 
									could lead to so much more that we personally couldn’t fathom. It will  advance our society and the way we live. For example, companies such as <em>Gatik's Autonomous Transportation</em> 
									are designing and testing self-driving electric delivery trucks that are made to  be self-sufficient and deliver goods 24/7 with little to no human support. They are a “<em>Transportation 
									as a Service (ATaaS) model [that] integrates into… customers’ supply chains at scale, enhancing reliability, lowering costs and increasing sustainability</em>”. This will result in supplies 
									being delivered more frequently, efficiently, eco friendly and at lower costs. This is just the beginning so truck drivers and others would be in the turmoil stage, but if you take a step 
									back and imagine what could be in store for everyone. Instead of one day delivery, we will have sub one hour delivery. Instead of worrying about the world due to carbon emissions, we will be 
									more organized so that we would have zero waste and zero fossil fuel emission due to transport. Imagine a period where this technology will be applied to personal flights so you can be anywhere 
									at any time which creates a world that is more united. We also see the <b>Spinning Jenny</b> as another example of a technological disrupter during the industrial revolution. It revolutionized the workforce 
									enabling a single person to make much more yarn than what used to be possible. Textile production opened up a new industry of fashion which is a 1.84 Trillion dollar industry. Additionally it made 
									social changes in which it freed up women to go and work jobs to earn money which was a first of its kind, Women were expected to stay indoors and do housekeeping. This opened up new doors. As 
									machines got bigger, it required more people to work in larger scales, instead of conducting this production at home, workers were shifted to work in factories. LLM’s (<b>large language models</b>) 
									like ChatGPT, compare to the spinning jenny, in which it used to take a long time and money to create websites, applications and create businesses, but LLMs now help in all of these processes. It can 
									help you generate a money worthy idea. It can help you learn new skills at a pace you never could before. It allows you to have a personal tutor at absolutely no cost. It can retrieve almost 
									any piece of human history with a simple question.

									<h2><a href="#" >AI Hurting Jobs</a></h2>
								</header>
								<p style="text-align: left;">
									&emsp;&emsp;Some might argue that the further implementation of AI will result in the loss of jobs to professionals who dedicated their lives to careers such as computer science, marketing, etc. 
									But, these professionals can turn it around and use AI to benefit themselves and stay on top of it. AI itself won't replace you, someone using AI might. Professionals, instead of looking at it 
									as a threat, see it as a way of amplifying human potential- that is, not using AI to replace, but rather enhance. For example, imagine a marketer who spent tons of time analyzing consumer trends, 
									now they can use AI to analyze it for them while they can contribute to an aspect that AI lacks like creative storytelling or branding strategies. For CS majors and professionals, AI can be used 
									as a job multiplier. They can become the architects who are able to integrate AI and master discernment of when it should and shouldn’t be used- as businesses often rely on specialized custom solutions. 
									Programmers can change the way of coding, evolving itself to a new potential. Programmers can go from having to write every single line of code manually, to orchestrating and tuning machine learning 
									models to push AI more to what it couldn’t do before. This could lead to more jobs, using their advanced knowledge and skill set, to further AI into becoming a more accurate system and pushing it to 
									limits it couldn’t go before. For more physical jobs like truck driving, they can shift focus from driving to more advancement and management of truck fleets. Truck drivers have the most experience 
									out of anyone in driving and they have faced all types of experiences that a software engineer would not have faced. They can use their experience which is not something everyone has to design and 
									brainstorm solutions to hard AI problems. An example that I could think of is if a tire goes out on a truck. A truck driver can easily know where to navigate to in order to be safe and then they 
									can easily switch the tire. An AI system won’t be able to know what area is safe for tire changing and it won’t be able to react well to a difference in tire pressures. A human with experience 
									needs to be there to teach AIs. Only a human can experience the world with all 5 senses and share. No AI can do that. We humans need to think out of the box. We need to be proactive disruptors 
									in our daily lives in order to innovate and generate solutions that have never been dreamt before. AI is another tool in our toolbox to grow and innovate and make the world a better place. 
									<b>Don’t be afraid but act now when we are given the opportunity.</b><br />
									&emsp;&emsp;All in all, AI will continue to grow and reshape industries just like how the industrial revolution shaped industries and labor of its time. There will be growing pain since 
									we need to learn to use this new tool. And just those people who were able to adapt to the new machines, we too will be able to thrive and achieve better efficiency if we choose to 
									adapt, adopt and combine AI.  We will not be a victim of replacement, but instead will be elevated in our workforce. AI isn’t the end, instead, it's a new beginning in these 
									already saturated markets. It is a new way of working, filled with <em>hyper efficiency, strategicness, higher level production and decision making</em>. 
									<b>Embrace AI, master its potential, and position yourself as a leader in this new era, because the future won’t wait for those who resist change.</b>
